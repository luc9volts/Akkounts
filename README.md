# Akkounts

### Playing with Akka.NET:

* Transactions and accounts are randomly generated by a background .net core worker service.
* Transactions (debit/credit) of each account will be handled by an Akka Actor.
* Each bubble represents an Akka Actor handling a account.
* The bubble size corresponds to the account balance.
* When an actor timeout expires, the color of correspondent bubble will turn gray.
