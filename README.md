# Akkounts

### Playing with Akka.NET:

* Each bubble represents an Akka Actor handling a transaction.
* The bubble size corresponds to the transaction value
* When an actor timeout expires, the correspondent bubble will disappear
* Transactions and accounts are randomly generated by a background .net core worker service
